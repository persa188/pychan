# pychan
README
**UNDER DEV: @CURRENT STATUS: Working, could use some additional functionality though**
This is a simple python script that downloads all of the wallpapers on the front page of 4chan.org/wg (possibly NSFW) OR
4chan.org/w (not  yet implemented, but if you would like to do this just change url variable in pychan.py)

REQ: this script requires BeautifulSoup & Python 2.7.10 (or 2.7 + pip)

Installation: in a terminal or command line type pip install beautifulsoup

Running: in a command line/terminal/ide run the pychan file. In the directory of 
the pychan file a /images directory will be created with all of the images
